# NYC Citibike 

## Overview
In this module, I will work with Tableau to present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company. 
I will import, style, and portray the data accurately, then create worksheets, dashboards, and stories to visualize key data from a New York Citi Bike dataset.
I will also present my findings.

 - Manhattan is the area, where people use bikes the most often.
 - Thurday is the day, when people use bikes the most often.
 - 7am to 9am and 4pm to 7pm are the two peak time, which means people use bikes to commute.

In order to do further visualizations, the following graphs can be made:
 -  Average Trip Duration by Age, from which we can find if birth year is related to the length of a bike ride?
 -  Bike Utilization by bikeID, from which we can know the number of trips per bike to see those bikes in bad conditions, required to be repaired.
